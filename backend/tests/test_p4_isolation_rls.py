"""Phase 4.2 (migration 0036) isolation RLS adversarial suite.

Runs AS the ``contact_ops_runtime`` role (a ``contact_ops_app`` member, not a
superuser, not bypassrls) — the same role the prod app uses — because RLS is only
meaningfully testable from an RLS-subject role. The design's merge gate for the
isolation_mode dial; also guards against future regressions of the strict wall.

Proves, with synthetic strict(S) / open(O) / standard(D) tenants and cross
membership + acl_grant shares:
  * A  legit share VISIBLE   — an open viewer sees a shared standard person + child.
  * B  strict owner HIDDEN   — a strict-owned person + child is invisible to a
        sharee that holds BOTH a membership AND an acl_grant (owner fence wins).
  * C  strict viewer NARROWED — a strict viewer sees none of a shared standard
        person + child (no commingling into the clean room).
  * D  owner sees OWN        — a strict owner still sees its own person + child.
  * E  writes owner-only     — cross-tenant UPDATE touches 0 rows; cross-tenant
        INSERT is blocked by RLS.
Plus coverage: every tenant-FK table has RLS, and persons/organizations carry
both RESTRICTIVE fences.
